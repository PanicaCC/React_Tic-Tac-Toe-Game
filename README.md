Game "Crosses - Zeros" created by React

Plans to improve game:
1. Displays the location for each move in (column, row) format in the move history list.
2. Highlight the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite the Board component to use two loops to create the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a radio button that allows you to sort the moves in ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that led to the victory.
6. When nobody wins, print a message about a tie.
